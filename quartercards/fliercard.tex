We do. And we want you to, too. Every year, the Linux Users' Group organizes
Installfest, where experienced Linux users help newbies install and try out the
operating system, as well as to show off working installs of different styles.

Why should you come? If you like playing with computers, like trying new things,
loathe Windows 8, or want to gush about the importance of free speech as it
applies to software, we're here to help.
